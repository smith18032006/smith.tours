# Important Note About Favicon Files

The SVG files created in the `public` directory are placeholders. For proper favicons, you should:

1. Use a proper favicon generator tool like https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
2. Upload your Smith-logo.png from the assets directory
3. Download the generated files and replace the ones in your public directory

For a quick test in development, you can use the SVG files that have been created, but for production, please generate proper ICO/PNG favicon files.

## Why these files aren't ready for production

The files created in this project are SVGs with PNG file extensions. Browsers expect actual PNG and ICO files for favicons. While some modern browsers might display the SVGs, older browsers and certain platforms will not recognize them properly.

To generate proper favicon files that will work everywhere, use one of the methods described in `favicon-guide.md`.
